## How to Use This Book

We organized this book so you can move from the big picture to hands-on execution:

- **[Introduction](INTRODUCTION.md)**: You are here. Start with the high-level overview and collect the setup steps you need.
- **[Design Philosophy](DESIGN.md)**: Understand the rationale behind each language decision before you dive into the details.
- **[Language Reference Manual (LRM)](LRM.md)**: Consult the formal grammar, value types, and control flow rules as you build programs.
- **[Interpreter (`naija`)](NAIJA.md)**: Learn how to run scripts from the command line using the `naija` CLI.
- **[Toolchain Manager (`naijaup`)](NAIJAUP.md)**: Manage installations, switch between versions, and keep your toolchain up to date.

## Let's Get Started

Begin by installing the toolchain manager and interpreter.

1. **Install `naijaup` (Toolchain Manager)**

   - **Linux or macOS:**
     ```sh
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xosnrdev/naijascript/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xosnrdev/naijascript/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex"
     ```
   - After installation, add `$HOME/.local/bin` (Linux/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.naijascript\bin` (Windows) to your `PATH`, then restart the terminal if your shell does not pick it up automatically.

2. **Install and Configure `naija` (Interpreter)**

   - Install the latest release:
     ```sh
     naijaup install latest
     ```
   - Set that version as the default:
     ```sh
     naijaup default latest
     ```

With the interpreter ready, continue through the remaining chapters and start building NaijaScript programs.
